# TO-DO-LIST APPLICATION

Description:
    This repository provides a simple yet versatile Python-based to-do list application, focusing on fundamental programming concepts such as file handling, user input, and data manipulation. The application enables users to manage their tasks through a command-line interface, incorporating features like adding tasks, marking them as done, viewing the entire task list, and even checking tasks for the current week. The code is organized into functions, each designed to perform a specific task, and the modular structure allows for easy expansion and customization. With docstrings providing clear guidance on the purpose and expected input for each function, this repository serves as a foundational template for developing interactive and functional console-based applications in Python.
